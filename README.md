## Description
MAGAHelpers is a very simple library of components I use to build out production applications.  The ultimate goal of open sourcing this chunk of code is to speed up the teaching and recording process for all the tutorials on my YouTube channel [LetsBuildThatApp](https://www.youtube.com/letsbuildthatapp).

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 8.3+
- Swift 3+

## Helpers

- [x] Layout Views
- [x] Color

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
To integrate MAGAHelpers into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:
```
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'MAGAHelpers'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
